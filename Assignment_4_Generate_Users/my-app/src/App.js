    For my personal interests, I love to play video games. My favorite genres
    are puzzle, platform, <br />
    Rpg, and Racing games. I also nostalgic at playing the classics. It is a
    little hard to get used <br />
    to the newer games.

      Below is my little creation named <b>"Frob"</b>. He is a funny armless
      dragon that is <br />
      rather cute. He has a taste for adventure and loves fruit. Come and pet
      him if you want.
