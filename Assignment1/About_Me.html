        <p>For my personal interests, I love to play video games. My favorite genres are puzzle, platform, <br>
           Rpg, and Racing games. I also nostalgic at playing the classics. It is a little hard to get used <br>
           to the newer games.</p>

        <p>More Things that interest me is sports. I do love watching sports on my leisure time. I prefer <br>
